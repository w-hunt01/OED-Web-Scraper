**Introduction**
/br/
This project is a simple python script using the Selenium library. The project was intended to scrape any applicable historical definitions, word frequencies, and etymologies, from the online the Oxford English Dictonary (OED). The script was designed to work with Safari as a web browser, and should print web content in such a way that delimited characters are used for export and manipulation in a file format such as MS Excel, and then ideally used as input data for another software system such as Tableau. 

**Important Caveat**
/br/
The script was also designed to use the OED subscription supplied by a local library. Earlier this year, however, the library in question changed policy such that only access through the main branch's wi-fi network could use the OED in full. As such, the script will not work for most users. Certain functions, however, such as ZLOOKUP and RLOOKUP may be appended to other web scraping bots, contingent that those users are similarly interested in philology and have appropriate OED access.
